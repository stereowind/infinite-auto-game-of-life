# Infinite Conway's Game of Life
This is a static-page infinite Game of Life that was created in under 20 minutes while trying out GitHub Codespaces and Copilot Agent.
All code is written by Copilot + GPT-4.1 .
Created from iPad Air in web version of Codespaces.

It was designed to run in landscape mode on my old iPad Mini 3 that I repurposed as a wall picture frame using iFramix frame.

* Automatic start of a new simulation when current one is stuck or dies out.
* Choice of standard and vaporwave-inspired colors for background and life cells.

### Controls
